Below is a brief summary of dates of CSF biomarker analyses run as batches of samples using the Luminex xMAP platform and Innogenetics INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay reagents.  Normalization of CSF biomarker data between results of 2007 and 2008 have been obtained using a statistical approach, resulting in a procedure to maintain lot-to-lot consistency within clinical studies.   In addition, during the further review of the pTau181p data a subset of CSF samples required quaranteening all pTau181p data from the late 2008 batch run.  The normalization applies to all t-tau, A_1-42 and pTau181p results, with the exception of the subset of pTau181p results that require a special correction procedure that is in the process of being completed.  That specific subset of data will be uploaded in the near future. Batch runs of ADNI CSF samples: COLLECTIONS 1. BASELINE CSFs were collected through early September 2007; 2. YR1 CSFs collected through late September 2008; 3. 24 month and 36 month sample collections-still ongoing. BIOMARKER BATCH TESTING: 1. BASELINE CSFs, batch tested Nov-Dec 2007, uploaded on ADNI website: A_1-42, t-tau, pTau181p data early 2008, THIS IS A FINAL DATASET (REPORTED in Annals of Neurology, 2009).  Data were reported on 410 subjects as described in the Annals of Neurology publication (Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker signature in Alzheimer_s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative subjects.  Shaw LM, Vanderstichele H, Knapik-Czajka M, Clark C, Aisen PS, Petersen RC, Blennow K, Soares H, Simon A, Lewczuk P, Dean R, Siemers E, Potter W, Lee VM-Y, Trojanowski JQ, Annals of Neurology 2009; available on the publisher_s website); 2. BASELINE, YR1 and 24 month samples batch tested Nov-Dec 2008 (Included 59 24 month CSFs), uploaded preliminary dataset Feb 2009, without pTau181p, and need for _bridge_ to 2007 data. We will soon follow up with a replacement upload of the A_1-42, and t-tau data following statistical normalization _bridging_ data collected using different lot numbers of Innogenetics research reagents. 3. Retested all 91 sets of _triplet_ CSF samples (BASELINE, YR1 and 24 month CSFs; each sample done using standard protocol and a new protocol to help deal with ptau), Feb-March 2009, analyses of these data are ongoing. 4. In addition, studies were done to bridge between single analyte testing and multi-analyte testing using a modified test procedure requiring lower volumes of CSF.  91 sets of _triplet_ CSF samples (BASELINE, YR1 and YR2) were tested using the standard protocol and a new test procedure to improve test accuracy for CSF p-Tau181p, Feb-March 2009.  Data analyses of this is on-going. If you have other questions about the work of the Biomarker Core, try http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/faq/ and http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/category/biomarker-core/.
