% function SSARes = StateSequenceAnalyze(SSAProb)
%
% StateSequenceAnalyze finds all non-dominated state sequences for a given
% continuous-time Markov chain, a given start state or set of start states,
% and a given final time. Optionally, it can, more generally, find the set
% of state sequences dominated by no more than MaxDom other sequences. (By 
% default, MaxDom=0, so that only the non-dominated state sequences are 
% returned.)
%
% INPUTS:
%
% Input SSAProb should be a structure containing:
% .L = vector of lambda values, one for each state of the chain
% .T = matrix of transition probabilities
% .Starts = Vector of possible start states that will be analyzed
% .Time = vector of time points at which to numerically evaluate the
%   probabilities or likelihoods -- or, if only a single time > 0 is given,
%   that is interpreted as the final time, with 1e+4 steps between 0 and
%   .Time taken to be the numerical grid. If a full vector of grid points
%   is specific, the first element (i.e. first time) must be zero.
% .MaxDom = optionally, largest number of state sequences that can dominate
%   a sequence before it is discarded. Defaults to 0, hence only
%   non-dominated sequences would be returned.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
% Returns a data structure SSARes, which includes:
% .SSAProb = the SSA problem being solved
% .TimeGrid = the numerical grid for evaluation of state sequence
%   probabilities and likelihoods
% .Seqs = an NxN cell array where N is the number of states of the chain,
%   in which .Seqs{i,j} is the set of non-dominated state sequences from
%   state i to state j. Each sequence is represented by a structure which
%   itself contains two fields: .seq is the state sequence, and .p is its
%   probability as a function of time.

% How many states in the system?
NStates = length(SSAProb.L);

% Determine the temporal grid for numerical solution of probability and
% likelihood functions
if length(SSAProb.Time)>1
