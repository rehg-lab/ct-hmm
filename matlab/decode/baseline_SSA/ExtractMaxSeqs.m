% ExtractMaxSeqs is inteded to extract sequences that are maximally
% probable somewhere, or more generally, are among the MMostProbable
% sequences. It takes as input:
%
% SSARes: The structure output by the StateSequenceAnalyze function.
% TimesToDo: One or more timepoints for which the sequences are desired.
% StartStates: Vector of starts states allowed for the sequences.
% EndStates: Vector of end states allwed for the sequences.
% MMostProbable: Defaults to 1 -- return sequences that are among the M
% most probable.
%
% It returns:
%
% Seqs: A cell array of vectors, each giving a state sequence
% MaxLists: A cell array of up to three dimensions, corresponding to choice
% of TimesToDo, StartStates
