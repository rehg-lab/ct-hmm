% [H, NFV] = num_hess(func, X, NFV, h)
%
% Function to compute the numerical Hessian of an arbitrary objective
% function.
%
% Inputs:
%	-> func: Function handle for which numerical Hessian is to be
%		obtained.
%	-> X: Point of interest about which Hessian is to be obtained.
%	-> NFV: Accumulator to keep track of number of function
%		evaluations.
%	-> h: Tolerance for differentiation.
%
% Outputs:
%	-> H: Numerical Hessian of function func (square symmetric
%		matrix of size n=length(X)).
%	-> NFV: Accumulator incremented by the number of function
%		evaluations which have taken place.

H = zeros(length(X));

% for each dimension of objective function

    % derivative at second point (right)
    x2 = X;

    % differentiate between the two derivatives
    d2f = (df2-df1) / (2*h);
    
    % assign as row i of Hessian
